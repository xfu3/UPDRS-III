# UPDRS-III

## Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and little is known about the trajectory of motor signs prior to death. 
Understanding deterioration patterns may help clinicians counsel patients and proactively plan 
interdisciplinary care, including palliative care. 

## Objective:
The objective of this study was to examine and describe Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale 
motor score (UPDRS-III) trajectories at the end of life in PD.

## Methods:
Trajectory patterns were visualized with Loess curves stratified by sex and age at diagnosis. 
Piecewise linear models were used to individually model the UPDRS-III scores, and the trajectories 
obtained were clustered based on their features.

## Result:
Among the 202 charts reviewed, 84 meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed. The UPDRS-III increased over 
time regardless of sex, and age. Distinct trajectory variations present in PD (Consistent Deterioration, 
Stability-Deterioration, Improvement-Deterioration, Deterioration-Stability-Deterioration) were identified. 
In addition, regardless of trajectory type, many patients experienced a steep increase in UPDRS-III approaching death. 
Those with disease diagnosis after age 65 years had a shorter survival time, compared to PD patients with a younger age of onset.

## Conclusion:
Our study identified dominant types of motor trajectory in PD that can help clinicians understand their patients’ course of illness.  
This information can help counsel patients regarding the variability in motor deterioration and should alert physicians to recognize 
a terminal decline. Age of disease onset was correlated with survival time.
